## Problem Statement

- A significant portion of the junior students faces difficulties in old methods of providing education. Traditional learning methods may struggle to capture and maintain children's attention, leading to 
  disengagement and a lack of interest in the educationalÂ material.
- The lack of visual representations can hinder their understanding and engagement with the material.
- The one-way communication model, where teachers primarily deliver information through lectures, limits interactive engagement. Kids may find the passive nature of learning less appealing
- The disconnect between theoretical knowledge and its real-world applications may not be emphasized in traditional classrooms. 
  


## Solution
We have created an EduQuestAR application for junior students which brings static educational content to life by overlaying digital information on real-world objects, making lessons more interactive and engaging.
3D models and animations based on NCERT/other book images can provide students with a deeper understanding of complex concepts.This platforms can be accessible to a wider audience, providing a more inclusive learning environment.Students with different learning abilities can benefit from interactive and visual content. It can provide instant feedback on student performance. Gamification elements, such as rewards, points, and challenges, can be integrated into AR-based educational experiences to make learning more enjoyable. Gamified Quizzes and assessments motivate students to actively participate and compete in a fun and educational manner.


### Target Audience 
- Students of 3 years old to 14 years old


### Revenue Model
- Offer EduQuestAR as a subscription service, where users pay a monthly or annual fee to access the platform. Different subscription tiers could provide varying levels of content, features, and support.
- Partner with educational publishers to integrate EduQuestAR into their digital content offerings. Publishers could offer EduQuestAR as a supplementary tool, enhancing the value of their textbooks or educational materials.

  
### Future aspects
- We use smart technology (AI) to quickly turn simple pictures into detailed 3D game stuff. This makes creating things for games faster and more accurate. It helps blend regular pictures into cool, lifelike game worlds easily.
