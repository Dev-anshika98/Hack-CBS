The facial analysis was spot-on and recommended products that actually worked for my oily skin. The water intake reminders and daily progress pics kept me motivated. It’s like having a personal skincare coach in my pocket!",

        comment: "Beautiful natural oil. I have been using this in the day and the rosehip one at night and given up on makeup! My skin feels amazing. I love that these are plastic free in their little metal bottles. I sourced them out specifically for that - bonus is that the oil and the company is lovely too. The only thing was, if you're looking for plastic free, they come with a plastic pump too which I wasn't expecting (though in hindsight I think it does say this in the listing) however it is useful and when I re-order I will just request now not to send one in my next order and reuse the ones I have. Product is brilliant, I would highly recommend",
